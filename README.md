# Density
calculates screen pixel density

input parameter res x, res y and inches-in-diagonal
returns screen size in mm^2, pixel density in mm^2

you can run program without parameter, and it'll output standard list of results of common res+size

oh and I'm sorry for this disgusting code. I truly suck at coding.
